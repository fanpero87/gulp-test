# Automation and midify files with Gulp

This example was taken from this [Youtube link](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4InNrO1phgA) an it's a tutorial for automating your front-end workflow with gulp how to use other packages like gulp-sass, autoprefixer, browser-sync and others.

**Notes:**

- You need to create the folder structure on both `src` and `dist` so that when you run the watch command the files can go there
- By default my system installed `"gulp-imagemin": "^8.0.0"` but this version was creating a problem so I had to downgrade the version to `"gulp-imagemin": "^7.1.0"`.
